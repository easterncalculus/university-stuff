Thoughts on a unique FYP Research and Development task:

-involve blockchain; but moreso in the sense of leveraging the blockchain via applications than mining
-would prefer to use Node.JS
-in addition, would like to build app via restful APIs - a 'stateless' webapp
    ie, send HTTP requests
    recieve responses indicating success/failure/etc
-bonus if I can incorporate integration with
    public blockchain libraries (blockcypher)
    private blockchain libraries (multichain, hyperledger)
    multisig transactions, shamir secret sharing



Developing a cryptocurrency betting pool plugin for gaming/esports:
    -plugin can be added to any online game
    -each player prepares externally their "ante"
    -the plugin will generate an address and display it to all players
    -each player sends crypto to that address (and specifies a return address; default being the send address)
    -the winner of the game recieves a payout of the entire pool; optionally there are rankings and winners are
     paid in order
    -application will (optionally) keep a cut of the pool to cover tx fees and generate revenue
    -the option for specialisation and scalable solutions over repeated use involving UTXO selection:
        tx fee = no. transactions * cost of transaction
        no. transactions = no. of winners / people drawing
        cost of transaction = no. of seperate utxos * fee
    -mathematically proven to payout fairly (based on game/success data being correctly reported by the parent app)
     with open-source code so that participants can verify the authenticity
    -applications in the gaming/esports industry:
    -can be based on players playing a game or viewers betting on a game - in which case the pool has the potential
     to have many winners, creating further complexity within fee management
    -possiblity to operate via smart contract (ethereum, hyperledger)
    -plugin operates on a webserver and is accessed via RESTful API calls from the parent application/game
        additional possiblity for scalability if a central pool is managed for many different pools.
        if different "ante" amounts are used across games, UTXO selection becomes much more fluid
        maintaining a profit despite tx fees and edge cases (ties and many players winning)

Shadow Ledger:
    -write to an immutable stream of events
    -view and inspect events
    -multiple applications but low complexity? depends on implementation.....

DRM Management system
    -using a serial number or other asset-like token to represent individual content items, we can utilise
     private key cryptography to securely provide access to the party involved in the ownership of said licence
     (an example would be an application - it requires a signature from the same address that contains the
     licence asset. If the asset is later transferred to another address then a signature from the new address is 
     required)
    -no double-accessing of DRM keys
    -proof of ownership, non-repudiation on behalf of the issuer (benefitting the consumer)
    -key is securely owned, cannot be easily reacquired, (benefitting the issuer)
    -if an address' private key is made known (to share a DRM licence to multiple parties) then it can also be 
     easily stolen by one of those parties via asset transfer - in which case it is restricted again to a single
     owner



Existing research projects I am interested in:

1 - A BitCoin Attack For Profit - Hans Vandierendonck
    improving hashing algorithms(?)
    attempt to mine a block 'quickly' ie faster than other miners
    at first glance seems impossible? given my current understanding of the protocol
    possible techniques include submitting specialised transactions (in varying numbers?)
        not sure what effect this could possibly have on the mining meta
        however, the reward for mining a block vastly outweighs many transaction fees, so this solution
        if possible, would be feasible
    My thoughts are that if this is sort of attack were really possible, someone would be utilising it right
     now to mine all of the transactions - but a technique that gives a marginal advantage over 
     other mining peers in a relaxed mining economy seems more possible.
    
2 - De-Anonymising Bitcoin: Identifying Users of Cryptocurrencies - Hans Vandierendonck
    claim that multiple addresses within a single wallet can be linked
        possible through use of an obvious change address?
    mixer exists that can help obsfucate this link
    project is focused on breaking this annoymity in a probabilistic manner using algorithms
    >This project involves the implementation of a graph analytics algorithm and requires 
     familiarity with probability theory, cryptocurrencies and algorithms.
        -as a side point, I would be interested in building a bitcoin 'mixer' app, as part of
         research towards solving this issue of limited anonymity.

3 - Meta Learning for Deep Reinforcement Learning - Vien Ngo
    Training a neural network to be good at learning. Very interesting project, but
     not related to any fields I have experiece with

4 - Keyword/phrase speech recognition without requiring noise training - Ji Ming

5 - -
