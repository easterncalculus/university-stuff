Final Year Research and Development Project

-both research component AND code

1) Working project (software) to gitlab
2) Research article (dissertation-like / max 15 pages)
3) Software development report (20% - brief)

schedule:
-shortlist of 5 projects due this sunday (30th september)
-preliminary research report due 23rd november
-research article and software development report due 29th april
-project showcase due 1st may 2019
-presenation slides + demo (TBA)

regular meetings with supervisor (and record meeting summaries/minutes, with signature in final doc)
avoid plagarism & referencing wikipedia in report 

Thoughts on my own research project:
-Blockchain related 
-Involve RBL (RESTful APIs, Node.js, multichain, blockcypher, docker)
-Cryptocurrency betting pool plugin for games


Existing research projects I am interested in:

1 - A BitCoin Attack For Profit - Hans Vandierendonck
    to do with hashing algorithms
    attempt to mine a block 'quickly'
    at first glance seems impossible?

2 - De-Anonymising Bitcoin: Identifying Users of Cryptocurrencies - Hans Vandierendonck
    claim that multiple addresses within a single wallet can be linked
        possible through use of an obvious change address?
    mixer exists that can help obsfucate this link
    project is focused on breaking this annoymity in a probabilistic manner using algorithms
    >This project involves the implementation of a graph analytics algorithm and requires 
     familiarity with probability theory, cryptocurrencies and algorithms.

3 - Meta Learning for Deep Reinforcement Learning - Vien Ngo
    Training a neural network to be good at learning. Very interesting project, but
     not related to any fields I have experiece with

4 - Keyword/phrase speech recognition without requiring noise training - Ji Ming

5 - -
