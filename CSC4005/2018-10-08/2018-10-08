Graph tips:
-label axis
-x-axis is independent axis (unchainging)
-include units
-include legend
-combine multiple graphs for the purpose of comparison
-might want to use a logarithmic graph for data that is spaced out at logarithmic distances

sample worst case scenario
find: aaaaaaaaab
text: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab (b needed?)
